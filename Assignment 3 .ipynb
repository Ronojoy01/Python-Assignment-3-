    "1. Why are functions advantageous to have in your programs?\n",
    "\n",
    "Ans - Function advantageous to have in program because, Functions reduce the need for duplicate code. This makes programs shorter, easier to read, and easier to update and also Improving clarity of the code."

    "\n",
    "Ans - A function is a piece of code which enhanced the reusability and modularity of your program. It means that piece of code need not be written again. A function call means invoking or calling that function. Unless a function is called there is no use of that function."

    "\n",
    "Ans - In general, a function takes arguments (if any), performs some operations, and returns a value (or object). The value that a function returns to the caller is generally known as the function's return value. All Python functions have a return value, either explicit or implicit.\n",
    "\n",
